# Limitations and Risks

## Data Limitations  
- CVs are short and unstructured  
- Job descriptions are limited in number  
- Gold evaluation dataset is intentionally small  

---

## Label Noise  
- Silver labels are automatically generated and may contain errors.  
- They are not used for final evaluation.

---

## Bias and Coverage Gaps  
- Skill dictionaries may not cover all domains  
- Semantic similarity may overestimate related experience  
- Similar job roles may be ambiguous  

---

## Misuse Risk  
The system should not be used for:
- Automatic hiring decisions  
- Legal or contractual judgments  
- Candidate filtering without human oversight  

---

## Explainability  
Rule-based matching provides partial explainability, but deeper reasoning is limited.
