# HR AI CV–Job Matching & Ranking System – Overview

## Purpose  
The HR AI CV–Job Matching & Ranking System is an AI-powered system designed to rank candidates for a given job description using a hybrid scoring approach that combines rule-based skill matching and semantic similarity from text embeddings.

The system focuses on ranking quality rather than binary classification, reflecting real recruiter workflows where candidates are reviewed as an ordered shortlist.
